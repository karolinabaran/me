# me

Feel welcome to visit the pinky web

If you are interested what's inside in the code, that's it:
- lots of PS and creative art
- fullPage.js plugin for the main site structure (for my beginner level was really hard to mix it with RWD though :(  )
- Typed.js for the intro (that's fancy now, right?:) I  like it:)
- animate.css (ready stuff to use)
- Sass for CSS
- fonts for the small pictures: Fontello and Font Awesome

- unfortunatelly, I recommend the visit mainly on Chrome ;)
